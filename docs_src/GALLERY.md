# Gallery

This repo is designed to be *shown*, so the gallery workflow is part of the project.

## How to generate “hero” screenshots
1. Run locally:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Pick a preset you like.
3. Use **Hero** profile (press **1**).
4. Toggle diagnostics **off** (press **D**) if you want a cleaner image.
5. Press **P** to export PNG.

## Where to store screenshots (suggested)
Put curated images in:
- `docs_src/screenshots/`

Suggested naming:
- `hero__preset-<name>__hero__001.png`
- `hero__preset-<name>__stress__001.png`

## Suggested set (6–10 images)
- 4 hero shots across distinct presets
- 2 stress shots (same presets) to show “scale”
- 1 with diagnostics visible (portfolio credibility)
- 1 “close-up” (lower particle count) that looks like ink calligraphy
