# JM — D-0003 (Seeded sim scaffold)

You are continuing **Inkswarm LifeLab** in Start-coding mode.

## Completed
- D-0003 implemented: seeded particle buffers + ping-pong compute + minimal particle render + app integration.

## Next
Implement **D-0004**:
- GPU grid binning (cellCounts + cellSlots)
- neighbor interactions using an interaction matrix
- enforce toroidal wrap for integration and neighbor deltas
- stability clamps

After D-0004:
- run **CR-0002** and apply improvements (esp. perf and code structure), then write CR journals.
