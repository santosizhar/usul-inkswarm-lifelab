# JM — CR-0002 (after D-0004)

You are continuing **Inkswarm LifeLab**.

## Current state
- D-0004 is complete.
- CR-0002 is complete and applied (persistent bind groups).

## Next gate
Before implementing **D-0005**, you MUST run a **CP** (planning) because CP triggers before D-0005.

When the user requests continuation:
- run CP-0002 (before D-0005)
- after CP OK: write J + JM
- then implement D-0005 and continue cadence.
