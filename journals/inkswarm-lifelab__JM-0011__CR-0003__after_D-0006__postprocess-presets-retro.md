# JM — CR-0003

CR-0003 is complete and improvements were applied:
- fixed bind-group indices via a unified pipeline layout
- avoided postprocess texture sampling hazards
- added resize-safe target recreation
- enabled clickable HUD controls and added preset pill styling
- tightened a couple TS types in App

## Next
Proceed with the roadmap:
- D-0007: screenshot export (PNG with HUD/diagnostics overlay)
- D-0008: diagnostics overlay (structured)
And per cadence: after this 2-deliverable block, this is a good point to push to GitHub.
