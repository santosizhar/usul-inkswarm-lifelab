# Inkswarm LifeLab — JM-0020 — CR-0005 (after D-0010) — Continue Prompt
Use this to continue work in the current repo state after CR-0005 is OK’d.

## Current state
- D-0010 completed: GitHub Pages build-to-`/docs` on `main` configured.
- Authored docs are under `docs_src/` (do not manually edit `/docs` unless it’s generated output from `npm run build`).
- CI checks: `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run check:pages` (ensures `docs/index.html` exists post-build).
- CR-0005 OK’d; journals are up to J/JM-0020.

## What to do next (fail-closed)
1) Run **RR-0002** for R2 (after D-0010). Do not tag/ship R2 without explicit OK.
2) If RR-0002 is OK’d:
   - Ensure a Pages-ready build is produced and committed (the `/docs` folder produced by `npm run build`).
   - Tag and create a GitHub Release for R2 (recommended: `v1.0.0` unless a different version is specified).
3) If any scope/requirements change, run CC before continuing.

## R2 release artifacts checklist
- `docs/` exists on `main` and contains `index.html` + `assets/*` generated by build.
- README + `docs_src/*` are consistent with actual behavior and controls.
- License posture is explicit: no license (all rights reserved by default).

## Gate questions to ask user
- “OK RR-0002” to ship R2.
- If version/tag differs from `v1.0.0`, ask for the exact version string (only if not already specified).
